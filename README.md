# Movie App

This is my first React project that showcases my learning with front-end and back-end technologies. The app uses **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Fetch**, **useState**, and **useEffect** to interact with an API and display movie information. It also utilizes **FontAwesome** icons and **Ant Design** for styling.

## Features

- **Movie Information:** Displays movie posters, titles, descriptions, vote averages, and vote counts.
- **Dynamic Ratings:** Users can rate movies with dynamic star icons.
- **Have Seen Button:** Users can mark movies they have seen using a clickable button.
- **Like/Unlike Movies:** Users can "like" movies by clicking a heart icon, and the movie will appear in a popover. 
- **Liked Movies Popover:** The popover displays all liked movies, with the ability to remove movies by clicking a delete button (X).
- **Deployment:** Deployed on Vercel with back-end API integration.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the app at [https://my-moviz-frontend-tan.vercel.app/](https://my-moviz-frontend-tan.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React (with Next.js)
  - Ant Design (Popover and Button components)
  - FontAwesome (Icons)
  - useState, useEffect (for handling state and side effects)
  - Fetch API (for data retrieval from the backend)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Fetch API to fetch data from The Movie Database (TMDb)
  
## Next Steps

This app is just the beginning! In the future, I plan to:
- Add a login system to allow users to save their liked movies.
- Implement movie reviews and comments.
- Enhance movie details (e.g., trailers, cast information).
- Explore more advanced features in React and Node.js.
